npm run autonomous:stop
```

### Manual Override Commands

```bash
# Force phase advancement (use with caution)
npm run autonomous:advance-phase

# Run specific phase optimizations
npm run autonomous:optimize-luxury
npm run autonomous:optimize-evolution
npm run autonomous:optimize-growth

# Emergency rollback
npm run autonomous:rollback
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics
