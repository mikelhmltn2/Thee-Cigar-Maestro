- React 18.3.1 with TypeScript support
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling

  - three-mesh-bvh (0.7.8)

## 🔄 Rollback Plan
If issues arise after deployment:
1. Stop the server: `pkill -f "next start"`
2. Clear build artifacts: `rm -rf .next/`
3. Restore previous build from backup
4. Restart with previous version
