# Pull Request: Fix Application Loading & CI/CD Pipeline Issues

## 🎯 Overview

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Application Loading Failure (Critical)

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Failures
**Problem:** Multiple GitHub Actions checks failing  
**Solutions Implemented:**
- **ESLint Errors:** Fixed 2 critical errors
  - Added proper `queueMicrotask` feature detection with fallback
  - Corrected promise executor return syntax
- **Prettier Formatting:** Fixed formatting in 254 files
- **TypeScript:** Verified compilation passes without errors
- **Build Process:** Ensured production build completes successfully
- **Tests:** All unit and integration tests passing
