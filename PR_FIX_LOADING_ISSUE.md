# Pull Request: Fix Application Loading Failure

## 🎯 Summary

Resolved critical application loading failure caused by missing npm dependencies. The application is now fully operational and accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The application was failing to load with the following root cause:

- **Missing Dependencies**: The `node_modules` directory was not present
- **Next.js Not Found**: The development server couldn't start because Next.js and other packages were not installed
- **Error Message**: `sh: 1: next: not found` when attempting to run `npm run dev`

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Installed NPM Dependencies**

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
