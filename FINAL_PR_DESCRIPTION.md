# 🚀 Fix: Application Loading Failure & CI/CD Pipeline Issues

## Summary
This PR resolves critical application loading failures and fixes all CI/CD pipeline checks to ensure the application is production-ready.

## 🔍 Problems Solved

### 1. Application Loading Failure
- **Issue**: Application failed to start with "next: not found" error
- **Root Cause**: Missing node_modules directory and npm dependencies
- **Impact**: Complete application failure, unable to run development or production builds

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Failures
- **ESLint Errors**: Code quality checks failing due to undefined globals and promise issues
- **Prettier Formatting**: 254 files with inconsistent formatting
- **Build Cache**: .next directory incorrectly tracked in git

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Dependencies & Setup
- ✅ Installed all npm dependencies (911 packages)
- ✅ Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle dependency conflicts
- ✅ Verified Next.js and all frameworks properly installed

### Code Quality Fixes
- ✅ Fixed ESLint errors:
  - Added proper feature detection for `queueMicrotask`
  - Fixed promise executor return syntax
  - Result: 0 errors (only non-blocking warnings remain)
- ✅ Applied Prettier formatting to all files
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation checks passing

### Build Optimization
- ✅ Removed .next build cache from repository
- ✅ Added .next to .gitignore to prevent future issues
- ✅ Production build completes successfully

## 📊 Testing & Verification

### Local Testing Results
```bash
✅ npm run dev          # Development server runs successfully
✅ npm run build        # Production build completes
✅ npm run type-check   # TypeScript: No errors
✅ npm test             # All tests passing
✅ npx eslint .         # ESLint: 0 errors
✅ npx prettier --check # Prettier: All formatted
```
