# 🔧 Fix: Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline Issues

## Summary
This PR fixes critical deployment and CI/CD pipeline issues that were preventing the application from loading correctly on Vercel and causing GitHub Actions checks to fail.

## Problems Solved

### 1. ❌ **Application Loading Failed Error**
- **Issue**: The Vercel deployment was serving static HTML files instead of the Next.js application
- **Solution**: 
  - Configured proper `vercel.json` for Next.js deployment
  - Added `.vercelignore` to exclude unnecessary files
  - Moved legacy HTML files to backup directory
  - Set up proper environment variables in `.env.production`

### 2. ❌ **CI/CD Checks Failing**
- **Issue**: Validation scripts were using CommonJS in an ES module environment
- **Solution**:
  - Converted `validate-data.js` and `integration-test.js` to ES modules
  - Updated all `require()` statements to ES6 `import` syntax
  - Fixed module entry point checks

### 3. ❌ **GitHub Actions Build Failures**
- **Issue**: Deploy workflow was using outdated static build process
- **Solution**:
  - Updated workflow to use Next.js build commands
  - Removed dependency on deprecated `deploy.sh` script
  - Added proper npm install and build steps

## Changes Made

### Configuration Files
- ✅ Created `vercel.json` with Next.js framework configuration
- ✅ Created `.vercelignore` to exclude development files
- ✅ Added `.env.production` with production environment variables
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.next/` build directory

### Scripts
- ✅ Converted `validate-data.js` to ES modules
- ✅ Converted `integration-test.js` to ES modules
- ✅ Created `deploy-nextjs.sh` for simplified deployment
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for Next.js

### File Organization
- ✅ Moved legacy HTML files to `backup-html/` directory
- ✅ Copied logo assets to `public/` directory for Next.js
- ✅ Removed `.next/` cache files from git tracking

## Test Results

### Local Testing
```bash
✅ TypeScript Check: PASSED
✅ Next.js Build: SUCCESSFUL
✅ Data Validation: 25/25 tests passed
✅ Integration Tests: All tests passed
✅ Local Dev Server: Running on port 3000
```

### Validation Output
```
📊 Integration Test Results Summary:
============================================================
✅ Passed: 25
❌ Failed: 0
⚠️  Warnings: 1

✅ GOOD: System is well integrated with minor recommendations.
```

## Deployment Status

- 🚀 **Next.js Build**: Successfully compiled with no errors
- 📦 **Bundle Size**: Optimized (First Load JS: 87.1 kB shared)
- 🔒 **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities
- ⚡ **Performance**: Build completes in < 30 seconds

## Breaking Changes
None - All changes are backward compatible and improve the deployment process.

## How to Test

1. **Local Testing**:
